# Path-of-Honour

"its not great but I am important"
"Approached it from a random perspective rather tried to game it"
"Press the attack to die for your country"
DIED

Lets try again

Stayed back instead of running in to die
Took risks but no reward
Listened to the omens
Takes risks based ona baby crying triumph 
You died
